# 05-Third-Party-APIs-NK

Fifth homework for UNH Coding Bootcamp: Third Party APIs (Daily Planner).  I added dynamic HTML elements through using JavaScript.  I used the provided style.css external style sheet to apply css to my daily planner and I also used the HTML skeleton that was provided with a few relevant classes defined at the start.  The majority of my work in this assignment was creating and building the script.js file.

Parts of Website: 
1. When the user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
2. When the user scrolls down, they are presented with timeblocks from 9AM-5PM.
3. The time blocks are color coded to show past, present, or future based on current time.
4. User can enter an event when clicking on a time block. 
5. When user clicks save button for time block, the text is saved in local storage.
6. When user refreshed the page, the saved events appear on the screen.

Challenges: The most difficult part for me was working with local storage in this assignment.  It took some time to correctly get the text in my <textarea> element to add to the correct index in an array, store that array in local storage, then display text back on screen (in correct order!). After some study groups and console logs, the daily planner works.
